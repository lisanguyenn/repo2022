> Designing Mobile Apps to improve user experience before, during, and after a healthcare visit.
> We plan to intergrate our application into the mobile format to make it more accessible and provide an easier transition from our infographics to social media
- [ ] Patient experience
> How do you incorporate the patient perspective through the intersection of patient, provider, and community data into care plans.
- [X] Health Disparities
> What is the role of big data and analytics in addressing health disparities among vulnerable and minority populations in San Diego County.
Our correlation/heat map will combine variables over multiple data sets to highlight how mediam household income can affect the health outcomes of San Diego residents. This will allow pollution clean-up efforts to direct their attentiom towards the highest-risk areas.
- [ ] Privacy and Security
> How can we increase data privacy and enhance cybersecurity measures in the release, exchange and use of healthcare data, both locally and nationally.
